# Interim 1

Started coding on 2019-05-15.



## Preamble

The sap has just been completed in draft and provided to the dsmb but not
yet submitted to Trials (because I don;t want to have to manage two sets
of reviewers concurrently).

At the time of writing my understanding is that there are approximately 
85 enrollees of which 70 have complete data thus triggering the first 
interim.

The first interim primarily involves a logistic regression to assess for 
stopping venous sampling or futility.

## Instructions

Open the project in Rstudio. Alternatively, invoke R from the project 
directory. To run the analyses, do:

```
source("interim/001/R/main.R")
```
